Breed Nirvana

   | I don't care (5x)
   | Care if it's old
   |
   | I don't mind (5x)
   | Mind, don't have a mind
   |
   | Get away (4x)
   | Away, 
   | Away from your home
   |
   | I'm afraid (5x)
   | Afraid of a ghost
   |
   | Even if you have
   | Even if you need
   | I don't mean to stare
   | We don't have to breed
   | We could plant a house
   | We could build a tree
   | I don't even care
   | We could have all three
   |

Even if you have
Even if you need
I don't mean to stare
We don't have to breed
We can plant a house
We can build a tree
I don't even care
We could have all three

Good!
