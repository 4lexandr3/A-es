Come Together The Beatles

Here come old flat top, He come
Groovin' up slowly, He got
Joo joo eyeballs, He one 
Holy roller, He got 
Hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine, He got 
Toe jam football, He got 
Monkey finger, He shoot 
Coca-Cola, He say 
I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together, right now, Over me

He bad production, He got 
Walrus gumboot, He got 
Ono sideboard, He one 
Spinal cracker, He got 
Feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease

Come together, right now, Over me

He roller coaster, He got 
Early warning, He got 
Muddy water, He one 
Mojo filter, He say 
One and one and one is three
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see

Come together right now, Over me
