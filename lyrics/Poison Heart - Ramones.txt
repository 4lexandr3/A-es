Poison Heart Ramones

No one ever thought this one would survive
Helpless child, gonna walk a drum beat behind
Lock you in a dream, I never let you go
I never let you laugh or smile, not you

2x | Well, I just want to walk right out of this world
   | 'Cause everybody has a poison heart

Making friends with a homeless torn up man
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday

2x | Well, I just want to walk right out of this world
   | 'Cause everybody has a poison heart

  A  poison heart, a poison heart, a poison heart

Yeah (solo 2x)

You know that life really takes its toll
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
So much damn confusion before my eyes
But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives

2x | Well, I just want to walk right out of this world
   | 'Cause everybody has a poison heart

I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
A poison heart     (7x)
